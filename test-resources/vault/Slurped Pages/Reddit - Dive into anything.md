Post pictures of cars with terrible mods Our Ethos (written Feb 2013): Shitty does not mean bad - Feel free to post #shitty mods that are awesome! There are many pieces of junk that we all wish we could own (who wouldn't want a Toyota Tercel with a LS V8 swap?). Just because it's #well done, It doesn't mean it's not shitty. #Sorry guys stuck in a scene from "The Fast and the #furious - 2001" This subreddit is #subjective! your idea of shitty isn't everyone's and vice versa.
